## Building
To run the project simply run `npm install` to install the required dependencies and then `npm start` to start the development version of the project. This project uses gulp as a build tool, so if gulp isn't already installed on your system you can do so with `npm install -g gulp-cli`.

To build the project run `npm run-script package` to build a version for your OS - the output of which will be in a folder named _packages.
